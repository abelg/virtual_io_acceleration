	tristate "Host kernel accelerator for virtio blk"
	depends on BLOCK && EVENTFD && m
	---help---
	  This kernel module can be loaded in host kernel to accelerate
	  guest block with virtio_blk. Not to be confused with virtio_blk
	  module itself which needs to be loaded in guest kernel.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called vhost_blk.
